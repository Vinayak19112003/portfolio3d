# Vinayak Deshmuk - Logic Craftsman

> "I don't just use AI — I explore its mind to restructure human logic."

A cinematic, 3D interactive portfolio website built with modern web technologies. This project features a unique integration of Spline 3D scenes with React, creating an immersive "Laboratory of Thought" experience.

## ✨ Features

- **3D Interactive Background**: A "Fireball" energy sphere that precisely follows your cursor in 3D space using raycasting logic.
- **Cinematic Design**: Dark mode aesthetic with glassmorphism, glowing text, and smooth animations.
- **Responsive Layout**: Customized for both desktop and mobile experiences (with optimized 3D handling).
- **Philosophy-Driven UI**: Components representing "Thought Experiments", "Manifesto", and "Capabilities".

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: [React](https://react.dev/) (TypeScript), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **3D & Animation**: 
  - [@splinetool/react-spline](https://spline.design/) (3D Scenes)
  - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (UI Animations)
  - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (Raycasting & Math)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🎮 Controls

- **Cursor**: Move your mouse to control the ethereal energy sphere in the background. The interaction uses precise camera raycasting logic to align the 3D object with your 2D cursor position.
- **Scroll**: Navigate through the philosophical sections of the portfolio.
